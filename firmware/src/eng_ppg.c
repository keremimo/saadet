/* PPG: a PPG Wave 2.2 group, written for Saadet from the 2.2's owner's manual and its wave EPROMs' layout. Engine 29
 * (26..28 are kept: HYDRA's user namespace and GR's two), behind SAADET_PPG.
 *
 * A voice: OSC and SUB read waves from the part's wave memory, the table's 64 and the upper table's 64, each wave a half
 * cycle of 64 bytes whose second half is the first played backwards and negated. A wave moves in whole waves and is
 * taken up at the next half cycle, so a sweep steps as the 2.2's does. Then the 24 dB low-pass (VCF-CUTOFF, EMPHASIS,
 * ENV 1, keys, touch, velocity, the LFO, the bender) and the loudness (ENV 2, keys, touch, velocity, the tremolo). ENV 1
 * also sweeps the waves; ENV 3, attack and decay, pulls the pitch of OSC, SUB or both and may sweep SUB's waves. The LFO
 * (four shapes, rate, delay) reaches pitch, waves, filter and loudness, its depth the wheel's.
 *
 * The waves are PPG's, read from a local image of the EPROMs at build time (tools/gen_ppg_waves.py, build/gen/ppg_rom.h)
 * and never kept in this repository. A table's key waves are blended into the slots between them when the table loads,
 * as the 2.2 computes its working memory. Tables 28 (a phasing saw) and 29 (pulse widths), which the 2.2 computes, and
 * the standard waves 60..63 are made here; their exact forms, the envelopes' and the LFO's curves, and the four LFO
 * shapes are this file's estimates until they are read from the 2.2's OS. No other implementation's code is used. */
